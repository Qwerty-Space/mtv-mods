# mtv-mods
Just some mods for morethan.tv in the form of a Tampermonkey script

## Wtf is this?
At the moment this Tampermonkey userscript fixes some styling issues, and adds a link to the bonus points market when you click "Seed Points".  Spawned from my habit of constantly clicking what looks like a link, but not getting anywhere, then having to click "market" instead.

## Requirements
* Tampermonkey for Chrome
* Greasemonkey for Firefox
